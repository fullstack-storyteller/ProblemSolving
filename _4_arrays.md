# Static & Dynamic Arrays

A static array is a fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range [0, n-1].

> Indexable - this means that each slot/index in the array
> can be referenced with a number

They have contiguous chunks of memory addresses. Some usage examples include:

- storing and accessing sequential data
- Temporarily storing objects
- used by IO routines as buffers
- Lookup tables and invers lookup tables
- Can be used to return multiple values from a function
- Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems
