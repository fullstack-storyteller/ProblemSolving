## Finding all the subsets of a set

For a given set S = {a, b, c}, the power **P(S)** set is a set which contains all possible subsets of S.

P(S) = {{}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}

General rule is that for a given Set with n distinct element, the power set contains 2<sub>n</sub> elements. Hence, total numbers of elements in S = 3, Total numbers of elements in P(S) = 8 (including the empty elements)
