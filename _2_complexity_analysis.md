# Computational Complexity Analysis

As programmers, we often find ourselves asking the same two questions over an onver again:

- How much time does this algorithm need to finish?
- How much space does this algorithm need for its computation?

## Big-O Notation:

There are other notations (Big-Omega, Big-Theta) too, but we are only interested in the Big-O notation.

**Big-O Notation** gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.
