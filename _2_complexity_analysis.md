# Computational Complexity Analysis

As programmers, we often find ourselves asking the same two questions over an onver again:

- How much time does this algorithm need to finish?
- How much space does this algorithm need for its computation?

## Big-O Notation

There are other notations (Big-Omega, Big-Theta) too, but we are only interested in the Big-O notation.

**Big-O Notation** gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.

Let's n - The size of the input complexities ordered in from smallest to largest.

| Name              | Big-O Notation |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| Constant Time     | O(1)           |
| Logarithmic Time  | O(log(n))      |
| Linear Time       | O(n)           |
| Linearithmic Time | O(nlog(n))     |
| Quadric Time      | O(n\^2)        |
