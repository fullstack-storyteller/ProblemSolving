# ProblemSolving [Data Structures & Algorithms]

This is the place where I will learn and practice the concepts and examples of data structures and algorithm for product based companies.

## Useful Links

- I'm following [this](https://youtu.be/RBSGKlAvoiM) video for learning DS and Algorithm
- For grasping the concepts of DS and Algorithms, I'm going to make use of the C# language itself. Any further changes or notes, I will keep here
- I will solve problems on Codechef (primarily), then move on to leetcode, Hackerrank, and Hackerearth as well
- Ultimate goal is to get placed in Microsoft and similar companies.
