# Introduction to Data Structures

**Data Structures** are used to represent data in a structred way. Structured data is easy and efficient to process.

- Example, let's assume there are multiple customers are gathered around a bank teller for their banking needs. From the teller's perspective this may not be an ideal situation and his work may be go on very efficiently. Now the same number of customers can be made to stand in a queue, this will ensure that the teller is not overwhelmed and is able to work through all the customers one by one. This is an example of queue data structures.

- Example, Lets say we have to represent our family members based on the father/mother and son/daughter relationship. To do that, we can have all the members stand in a line, but that arrangement will not help us determine who is who's father/mother or son/daughter. But if we can do a hierarcial representation who father and mother in same level and sons and daughter below them, that will be much more easy to understand and process. This arrangement is called a tree.

- Example, A map which contains various cities and the path to travel between them is an example of graph. We will learn more about them as we progress further.

## Types of Data Structures
