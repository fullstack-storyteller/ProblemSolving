# Introduction to Data Structures

- **Data Structures** is a way of organinsing data so that it can be used (accessed / queried / even updated) effectively.

- They are esential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.

- They help manage and organise data.

- They make code cleaner and easier to understand

## Abstract data Types vs. Data Strucutres

An **abstract data type** (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

**Data Structure** is the actual implementation of the ADT.

| Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS)                                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LIST              | Dynamic Array, Linked List                                    |
| QUEUE             | Linked List Based queue, Array based queue, stack based queue |
| MAP               | Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table                               |
| Example: Vehicle  | Example: Golf Cart, Bicycle, Smart Car                        |
